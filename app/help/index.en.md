# Help

Welcome to Paperwork! Here is, where the help is going to be. We introduced a few specialities to the Markdown used to generate this help pages from:

* Help URLs: For linking to other help pages, simply use the following format: `[this is a link](@help.folder.anotherfolder.file)`
* Help images: For displaying images that are stored in the public/images/help/-folder, use this: `![my image](@image.ay-caramba.png "Ay caramba!")`
